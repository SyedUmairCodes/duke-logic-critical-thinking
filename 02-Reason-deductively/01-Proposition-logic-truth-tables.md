# Introduction to Deductive Logic
0:03
Welcome to the second unit of our course. In the first unit of the course, you learned how to listen to what someone was saying, or read what they wrote and separate out the arguments that they were giving from the rest of their words. You learned what arguments are, what their parts are, and how those parts work together to achieve the various purposes of argument.

Now in this second unit of the course, and the third unit that follows it, you'll learn some rules for evaluating the success of arguments. In particular in the second unit of the course, we'll focus on rules for evaluating the validity of deductive arguments. And then in the third unit of the course, we'll focus on rules for evaluating the strength of inductive arguments. Recall that deductive arguments are arguments that are presented as being valid, and they are successful only if they're valid. Inductive arguments, in contrast, are arguments that are not presented as being valid. They're presented as being strong, and they're successful only to the extent that they are strong.

Okay, now since in this second unit of the course we're focusing on rules for evaluating the validity of deductive arguments, let me say a bit more now about validity and about the rules for assessing validity.
Play video starting at :1:26 and follow transcript1:26
See, I just got a new pet clownfish, Nimo.
Play video starting at :1:32 and follow transcript1:32
Now maybe you don't know much about clown fish anatomy,
Play video starting at :1:38 and follow transcript1:38
but I'm going to try to persuade you right now that clown fish have gills.
Play video starting at :1:43 and follow transcript1:43
Here's an argument that I could give you for the conclusion that clownfish have gills.
Play video starting at :1:49 and follow transcript1:49
Well, catfish have gills, goldfish have gills and sharks have gills. Therefore, clownfish have gills.
Play video starting at :2: and follow transcript2:00
Now, is that argument valid?
Play video starting at :2:3 and follow transcript2:03
No, it's not.
Play video starting at :2:4 and follow transcript2:04
It's not valid because it's possible for the premises to be true even when the conclusion is false. It could be that catfish and sharks and goldfish all have gills, even though clownfish don't.
Play video starting at :2:23 and follow transcript2:23
But now suppose I give you a different argument for the conclusion that clown fish have gills.
Play video starting at :2:30 and follow transcript2:30
Here's how this different argument goes. All fish have gills. Clown fish are a kind of fish. Therefore, clownfish have gills.
Play video starting at :2:41 and follow transcript2:41
Now, that argument is valid. There's no possible way for the premises of that argument to be true if the conclusion is false. Recall that in the first unit of the course, Walter defined validity as follows. He said that an argument is valid if there is no possible way for all the premises of the argument to be true while the conclusion is false. And he gave an example of an argument that was valid. The example, recall, went like this. Premise one, Mary has a child who is pregnant.
Play video starting at :3:13 and follow transcript3:13
Premise two, only daughters can become pregnant.
Play video starting at :3:18 and follow transcript3:18
Therefore, conclusion, Mary has at least one daughter.
Play video starting at :3:24 and follow transcript3:24
Now remember, as Walter pointed out, you can imagine situations where the first premise is false. Maybe Mary doesn't have a child who was pregnant. You can imagine situations in which the second premise is false. Maybe not only daughters can become pregnant, maybe there's some way for sons to become pregnant, or maybe there's some way for children from some third gender or some unspecified gender to become pregnant.
Play video starting at :3:51 and follow transcript3:51
And you can imagine a situation which the conclusion is false, in which Mary doesn't have at least one daughter. But what you can't imagine, what's completely incoherent, what's completely impossible is for there to be a situation in which both of the premises are true, and the conclusion is false.
Play video starting at :4:8 and follow transcript4:08
In any possible situation, either the premises, in any possible situation in which the premises are true, the conclusion has to be true.
Play video starting at :4:22 and follow transcript4:22
There's no possible situation for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.
Play video starting at :4:27 and follow transcript4:27
So that's what makes that argument valid.
Play video starting at :4:31 and follow transcript4:31
Now what I'd like to do right now is show that there are other arguments that have the same form as this first argument about Mary and are valid for what seems to be the same reason as the argument about Mary is valid, even though they have a completely different subject matter.
Play video starting at :4:50 and follow transcript4:50
So here's another example, consider the following argument. Premise one, Terry has a job in which she arrests people.
Play video starting at :5: and follow transcript5:00
Premise two, only police officers can arrest people.
Play video starting at :5:4 and follow transcript5:04
Therefore, conclusion, at least one of Terry's jobs is as a police officer.
Play video starting at :5:14 and follow transcript5:14
Now again.
Play video starting at :5:15 and follow transcript5:15
Maybe, premise one of this argument is false. You can certainly imagine that it's false, right? Maybe Terry doesn't have a job in which she arrests people. Maybe premise two of the argument is false, you can imagine a situation which not only police officers can arrest people. Maybe there's a world in which police officers, and judges, and plumbers, and actors can all arrest people.
Play video starting at :5:42 and follow transcript5:42
And, of course, you can imagine a situation which the conclusion is false, in which it's not true that at least one of Terry's jobs is as a police officer.
Play video starting at :5:54 and follow transcript5:54
But what you can't imagine, what's completely impossible, is that both of the premises of that argument are true and the conclusion is false. If both of the premises of that argument about Terry are true, the conclusion has to be true, and so the argument is valid. The argument about Terry is valid, just as the argument about Mary is valid.
Play video starting at :6:16 and follow transcript6:16
And notice the two arguments have completely different subject matters. The first is about Mary's children, the second is about Terry's jobs.
Play video starting at :6:24 and follow transcript6:24
But even though they have completely different subject matters, they have something in common. There seems to be something in common to their form. Something signaled by their use of the terms only and at least.
Play video starting at :6:38 and follow transcript6:38
Something in common to the two arguments that explains why they're valid.
Play video starting at :6:44 and follow transcript6:44
To get at what this common feature is a bit more clearly, let me give a third and final example of this form. Let's see if you get the idea.
Play video starting at :6:56 and follow transcript6:56
So consider the following argument. Premise one, Robert has a pet who is canine.
Play video starting at :7:2 and follow transcript7:02
Premise two, only mammals can be canine. So conclusion, Robert has at least one pet who is mammal.
Play video starting at :7:12 and follow transcript7:12
Now, of course you can imagine a situation in which premise one is false. Maybe Robert doesn't have any canine pets. You can imagine a situation which premise two is false. In which not only mammals are canine, maybe some canines are reptiles, or some canines are robots, or who knows.
Play video starting at :7:31 and follow transcript7:31
And of course you can imagine a situation where the conclusion is false, in which Robert doesn't have any mammal pets. Maybe all of his pets are birds or reptiles, or maybe he doesn't have any pets. But in any case, you can imagine these possibilities. But what you cannot imagine, what's completely ruled out, is the possibility that the premises of that argument are true and the conclusion is false. If the premises of the argument are true, the conclusion has got to be true. And so this argument about Robert is also valid, just like the arguments about Mary and Terry were valid.
Play video starting at :8:6 and follow transcript8:06
But of course this argument about Robert has a completely different subject matter than the arguments about Mary or Terry. One was an argument about Mary's children, the other was an argument about Terry's jobs and this is an argument about Robert's pets.
Play video starting at :8:20 and follow transcript8:20
Completely different subject matters, but they're all valid, and it seems they're all valid for the same reason. They have the same form, and it's a form that's signaled by their use of the phrases only and at least.
Play video starting at :8:39 and follow transcript8:39
So what we'll be doing in the second unit of the course is studying the forms of valid argument. The forms that explain why valid arguments are valid.
Play video starting at :8:54 and follow transcript8:54
Now in the arguments that we just looked at, the arguments about Mary, Terry, and Robert, their common form, I said, involved the use of the word only and it also involved the use of the phrase at least.
Play video starting at :9:8 and follow transcript9:08
Only and at least are both phrases that we're going to call quantifiers.
Play video starting at :9:13 and follow transcript9:13
And next week, in week five of the course, when we study the subject that we're going to call categorical logic, we're going to be studying in particular quantifiers like only, at least, some, all, none, and phrases like that. And we're going to be studying how the use of phrases like that, the use of quantifiers, can make arguments valid no matter what those arguments are about. If the arguments use quantifiers like only, at least, some, all and none in certain ways, then those arguments are going to be valid regardless of their subject matter.
Play video starting at :9:52 and follow transcript9:52
But this week, in week four, we're not going to be studying quantifiers like only or at least, instead we're going to be studying a kind of phrase that we're going to call a propositional connective. In particular, a kind of propositional connective that we'll call a truth-functional connective. So what are propositional connectives? What are truth-functional connectives? How do they work to make arguments valid? Those questions and more, we'll address in the next lecture.

# Propositions and Propositional Connectives
This week we're going to be studying propositional logic, which is the rules that determine the validity of an argument based on the propositional connectives that are used in that argument. Now I've said a little bit about propositional connectives, but in order to say more about what propositional connectives are, in particular, in order to give the definition of propositional connectives, I have to start out by giving a definition of propositions. So what are propositions? A proposition is the kind of thing that can be true or false and that can be the premise or the conclusion of an argument.
Play video starting at ::37 and follow transcript0:37
Let me give you some examples to illustrate that definition.
Play video starting at ::45 and follow transcript0:45
See these binoculars? These binoculars are not a proposition. They can't be true or false, and they can't be the premise or the conclusion of an argument.
Play video starting at :1: and follow transcript1:00
See this hand? This hand is not a proposition.
Play video starting at :1:5 and follow transcript1:05
This hand cannot be true or false, and it can't be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. But now suppose I say the binoculars are in my hand. Now what I just said, that the binoculars are in my hand, that is the kind of thing that can be true or false. For instance, right now it's true, and right now it's false.
Play video starting at :1:32 and follow transcript1:32
It's also the kind of thing that could be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. For instance, I could say the binoculars are in my hand. Therefore, my hand is not free to shake yours.
Play video starting at :1:45 and follow transcript1:45
Or I could say, you just gave me the binoculars and I haven't let go of them. Therefore, the binoculars are in my hand. >> See? So that the binoculars are in my hand, that's a proposition. That's the kind of thing that can be true or false, and that can be the premise or the conclusion of an argument.
Play video starting at :2:9 and follow transcript2:09
Now, now that we know what propositions are, what's a propositional connective? A propositional connective is something that takes propositions and connects them to create new propositions.
Play video starting at :2:27 and follow transcript2:27
For instance, sometimes, in English, the word and can work as a propositional connective.
Play video starting at :2:36 and follow transcript2:36
So let me give you an example of how, in English, the word and can sometimes function as a propositional connective.
Play video starting at :2:44 and follow transcript2:44
So consider the proposition I'm holding the binoculars. That's a proposition. It's the kind of thing that can be true or false, and it's the kind of thing that can be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. Well, there's also the proposition I'm looking through the binoculars, right? That's the kind of thing that can be true or false, and it's the kind of thing that can be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. Well, you could use the word and to connect up those two propositions to make a new proposition. The new proposition would be I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them.
Play video starting at :3:21 and follow transcript3:21
See, now that's a proposition. It's the kind of thing that can be true or false, and it's also the kind of thing that could be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. For instance, right now it's true that I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them, whereas right now it's false that I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them.
Play video starting at :3:42 and follow transcript3:42
I could say, what you're seeing right now is really happening. Therefore, I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them.
Play video starting at :3:51 and follow transcript3:51
Or I could say, I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them. Therefore, I should not be driving a car right now.
Play video starting at :4:1 and follow transcript4:01
You see? So that I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them is also a proposition. It's the kind of thing that can be true or false, and it's the kind of thing that can be the premise or the conclusion of an argument.
Play video starting at :4:15 and follow transcript4:15
But it's a proposition that we created by combining two other propositions, namely the proposition I'm holding the binoculars and the proposition I'm looking through the binoculars, by combining those two propositions with the word and. So that's an example of how the word and, in English, can work as a propositional connective, connecting two propositions into a third proposition.
